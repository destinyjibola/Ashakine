During a hackathon, I developed **Crowdfund+**, a donation web app designed to make fundraising flexible and accessible. Whether it’s for personal causes like birthdays or funerals, or larger community projects like rebuilding schools, the platform simplifies creating and managing campaigns.

**Crowdfund+** is also tailored for faith-based organizations and NGOs. It includes a **tithing feature** that allows members to set up recurring donations automatically, ensuring consistent contributions. Organizations can even run **private campaigns**, accessible only to their members through email invites.

**The app features:**

- **Real-time updates** via Socket.IO, letting users see donations as they happen (in development).
- **Push notifications** powered by Firebase to keep campaign contributors engaged (in development).
- A comprehensive **dashboard** for managing donations, campaigns, and contributed projects (Already integrated).
- **Paystack integration** for secure payment processing with multiple **payment options**, allowing users to donate efficiently through various gateways (Already integrated).
- Users can **create campaigns** for different causes ,be it personal, community, or NGO-based (Integrated).
- **Recurring donations** through the tithing feature for faith-based initiatives (In development).
- **Private funding options** for NGOs to create campaigns visible only to their members (In development).

The app is built using **Next.js** (React framework), **Node.js**, **MongoDB/Mongoose , TailwindCSS** for styling, and **Cloudinary** for file uploads, all deployed on **Vercel**.

It’s already at a significant stage, but I’m continuously working on new features to make it even better, one functionality at a time.
